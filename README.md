Personal computer configuration using Nix

Tries to adhere to [dendritic Nix](https://github.com/Doc-Steve/dendritic-design-with-flake-parts) design patterns, as it keeps things modular and leverages the flake-parts module system well. Also aims to keep features separately defined from hosts, for easy reuse across hosts (nixos and darwin).
